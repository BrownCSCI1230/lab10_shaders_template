#version 330 core

//TASK 4: declare position and normal variables using the layout keyword
// - look at initializeGL() in GLRenderer to discover which index corresponds to which attribute

//TASK 5: declare out variable for position and normal to pass to fragment shader

//TASK 6: declare uniform variable to store model matrix

//TASK 7: declare uniforms for view and projection matrix

void main() {
//TASK 8: using model and view matricies transform position and vertex data into camera space
//        then pass the transformed data to the fragment shader using the variables created in Task 5


//TASK 9: set gl_Position to the vertex position transformed to clip space
