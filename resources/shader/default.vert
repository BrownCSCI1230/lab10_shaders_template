#version 330 core

// Task 4: declare position and normal variables using the layout keyword
// - look at initializeGL() in GLRenderer to discover which index corresponds to which attribute

// Task 5: declare out variable for position and normal to pass to fragment shader

// Task 6: declare uniform variable to store model matrix

// Task 7: declare uniforms for view and projection matrix

void main() {
    // Task 8: using model and view matricies transform position and vertex data into camera space
    //        then pass the transformed data to the fragment shader using the variables created in Task 5

    // Task 9: set gl_Position to the vertex position transformed to clip space
}
